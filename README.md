# Carrom-Game
A 2D multiplayer Carrom Board game I made as a course project for "Fundamentals of Computer Programming" in my 1st Semester of Bachelor's. It is developed using GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit).
The code has massive room for improvements (both to organization and to performance), as it was written in my first few months of coding practice.

To run the game, clone the project and compile it using Visual Studio (tested against VS2015 and VS2019).
